# Dodona Oefeningen

## What is this?

This repository has all the answers to the exercises on Dodona.

This is not supposed to be used as a way to get the answer. But as a way to learn what the program is supposed to do.

## Do all the exercises have an answer, and do all answers work?

Yes! All exercises have an answer, and all answers work. All answers have been tested and are working. The only reason an answer might not work is because the exercise has been updated and the answer has changed.

## How do I use this?

Just look for the folder where your exercise is, find your exercise and look at the code! It really can't be easier than that.

## What is `Toetsen`?

[Toetsen](/Toetsen) is a folder where 4th year students can find the answers of the IT tests after the test is done, this sadly is not available for the 3rd years, as I don't have the answers to those tests.

This is also just a way to learn what the program is supposed to do, and not a way to cheat. These answers are only available after the test is done (to prevent students from cheating).

### Toetsen might be deleted in the near future

This is because i don't think that we're going to get anymore tests, and because just having one set of answers is quite useless this folder might be deleted.
